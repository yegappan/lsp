1. Overview					*lsp-overview*

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) plugin implements a LSP client for Vim9.
Refer to the following pages for more information about LSP:

    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/
    https://langserver.org/

This plugin needs Vim version 9.0 and after. You will need a programming
language specific server in your system to use this plugin. Refer to the above
pages for a list of available language servers for the various programming
languages.

The Github repository for this plugin is available at:

      http://github.com/yegappan/lsp

4. Configuration				*lsp-configuration*
					*LspAddServer()* *g:LspAddServer()*

To use the plugin features with a particular file type(s), you need to first
register a language server for that file type(s).

To register one or more language servers, use the LspAddServer() function with
a list of lanaguge server details in the .vimrc file.

To register a language server, add the following lines to your .vimrc file
(use only the language servers that you need from the below list).
If you used [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install the
LSP plugin, the steps are described later in this section: >

   let lspServers = [
		\     #{
		\	 name: 'typescriptls',
		\	 filetype: ['javascript', 'typescript'],
		\	 path: '/usr/local/bin/typescript-language-server',
		\	 args: ['--stdio']
		\      },
		\     #{
		\	 name: 'pythonls',
		\	 filetype: 'python',
		\	 path: '/usr/local/bin/pyls',
		\	 args: ['--check-parent-process', '-v']
		\      }
		\   ]
   call LspAddServer(lspServers)
<
Depending on the location of the typescript and python pyls language servers
installed in your system, update the "path" in the above snippet
appropriately.

Another example, for adding the language servers for the C, C++, Golang, Rust, 
Shell script, Vim script and PHP file types: >

   let lspServers = [
		\     #{
		\	 name: 'clangd',
		\        filetype: ['c', 'cpp'],
		\        path: '/usr/local/bin/clangd',
		\        args: ['--background-index']
		\     },
                \     #{ 
		\	 name: 'golang',
                \        filetype: ['go', 'gomod', 'gohtmltmpl', 'gotexttmpl'],
                \        path: '/path/to/.go/bin/gopls',
                \        args: [],
                \        syncInit: v:true,
                \      },
                \     #{
		\	 name: 'rustls',
                \        filetype: ['rust'],
                \        path: '/path/to/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer',
                \        args: [],
                \        syncInit: v:true,
                \      },
		\     #{
		\	 name: 'bashls',
		\	 filetype: 'sh',
		\	 path: '/usr/local/bin/bash-language-server',
		\	 args: ['start']
		\     },
		\     #{
		\	 name: 'vimls',
		\	 filetype: ['vim'],
		\	 path: '/usr/local/bin/vim-language-server',
		\	 args: ['--stdio']
		\     },
		\     #{
		\	 name: 'phpls',
		\        filetype: ['php'],
		\        path: '/usr/local/bin/intelephense',
		\        args: ['--stdio'],
		\        syncInit: v:true,
		\        initializationOptions: {
		\          licenceKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
		\        }
		\      }
		\   ]
   call LspAddServer(lspServers)
<
To add a language server, the following information is needed:

						*lsp-cfg-name*
	name		(Optional) name of the language server.  Can by any
			string.  Used in LSP messages and log files.
						*lsp-cfg-path*
	path		complete path to the language server executable
			(without any arguments).
						*lsp-cfg-args*
	args		a list of command-line arguments passed to the
			language server. Each argument is a separate List
			item.
						*lsp-cfg-filetype*
	filetype	One or more file types supported by the language
			server.  This can be a |String| or a |List|. To specify
			multiple file types, use a List.
						*lsp-cfg-initializationOptions*
	initializationOptions
			(Optional) for lsp servers (e.g. intelephense) some
			additional initialization options may be required
			or useful for initialization. Those can be provided in
			this dictionary and if present will be transmitted to
			the lsp server.
						*lsp-cfg-workspaceConfig*
	workspaceConfig (Optional) a json encodable value that will be sent to
			the language server after initialization as the
			"settings" in a "workspace/didChangeConfiguration"
			notification.  Refer to the language server
			documentation for the values that will be accepted in
			this notification.  This configuration is also used to
			respond to the "workspace/configuration" request
			message from the language server.
						*lsp-cfg-rootSearch*
	rootSearch	(Optional) a List of file and directory names used to
			locate the root path or uri of the workspace.  The
			directory names in "rootSearch" must end in "/" or
			"\".  Each file and directory name in "rootSearch" is
			searched upwards in all the parent directories.  If
			multiple directories are found, then the directory
			closest to the directory of the current buffer is used
			as the workspace root.

			If this parameter is not specified or the files are not
			found, then the current working directory is used as the
			workspace root for decendent files, for any other files
			the parent directory of the file is used.

						*lsp-cfg-runIfSearch*
	runIfSearch	(Optional) a List of file and directory names used to
			determinate if a server should run or not. The directory
			names in "runIfSearch" must end in "/" or "\".  Each
			file and directory name in "runIfSearch" is searched
			upwards in all the parent directories.  Exactly like
			|lsp-cfg-rootSearch|.

			If a file or directory is found then the server will be
			started, otherwise it will not.

			If this parameter is not specified or is an empty list,
			then the server will be started unless
			|lsp-cfg-runUnlessSearch| prevents it.

						*lsp-cfg-runUnlessSearch*
	runUnlessSearch	(Optional) Opposite of |lsp-cfg-runIfSearch|.

Additionally the following configurations can be made:

					*lsp-cfg-customNotificationHandlers*
	customNotificationHandlers
			(Optional) some lsp servers (e.g.
			typescript-language-server) will send additional
			notifications which you might want to silence or handle.
			The provided notification handlers will be called with a
			reference to the "lspserver" and the "reply". >

		vim9script
		g:LspAddServer([{
			filetype: ['javascript', 'typescript'],
			path: '/usr/local/bin/typescript-language-server',
			args: ['--stdio'],
			customNotificationHandlers: {
				'$/typescriptVersion': (lspserver, reply) => {
					echom printf("TypeScript Version = %s",
						reply.params.version)
				}
			}
		}])
<
					*lsp-cfg-features*
	features
			(Optional) toggle which features should be enabled for a
			given language server. See |lsp-multiple-servers| and
			|lsp-features| for more information.
						*lsp-cfg-omnicompl*
	omnicompl	(Optional) a boolean value that enables (true)
			or disables (false) omni-completion for this file
			types. By default this is set to "v:true".
						*lsp-cfg-syncInit*
	syncInit        (Optional) for language servers (e.g. rust analyzer,
			gopls, etc.) that take time to initialize and reply to
			a "initialize" request message this should be set to
			"v:true". If this is set to true, then a synchronous
			call is used to initialize the language server,
			otherwise the server is initialized asynchronously.
			By default this is set to "v:false".
						*lsp-cfg-debug*
	debug		(Optional) log the messages printed by this language
			server in stdout and stderr to a file.  Useful for
			debugging a language server.  By default the
			messages are not logged.  See |lsp-debug| for more
			information.

The language servers are added using the LspAddServer() function. This function
accepts a list of language servers with the above information.

If you used [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install the LSP
plugin, then you need to use the VimEnter autocmd to initialize the language
server and to set the language server options.  For example: >

    let lspServers = [
		\     #{
		\        name: 'clangd',
		\        filetype: ['c', 'cpp'],
		\        path: '/usr/local/bin/clangd',
		\        args: ['--background-index']
		\      }
		\   ]
    autocmd VimEnter * call LspAddServer(lspServers)

    let lspOpts = {'autoHighlightDiags': v:true}
    autocmd VimEnter * call LspOptionsSet(lspOpts)
<
						*lsp-options* *LspOptionsSet*
						*g:LspOptionsSet*

Some of the LSP plugin features can be enabled or disabled by using the
LspOptionsSet() function. This function accepts a dictionary argument with the
following optional items:

						*lsp-opt-autoComplete*
autoComplete		|Boolean| option. In insert mode, automatically
			complete the current symbol. Otherwise use
			omni-completion. By default this is set to true.

			This option only works for language servers that expect
			the client to filter the completion items.

			This option accepts one of the following values:
			    case  - case sensitive matching (default).
			    fuzzy - fuzzy match completion items.
			    icase - ignore case when matching items.
						*lsp-opt-completionTextEdit*

5. Commands					*lsp-commands*

A description of the various commands provided by this plugin is below.  You
can map these commands to keys and make it easier to invoke them.

						*:LspCodeAction*
:LspCodeAction [query]	Apply the code action supplied by the language server
			to the diagnostic in the current line. This works only
			if there is a diagnostic message for the current line.
			You can use the |:LspDiagCurrent| command to display
			the diagnostic for the current line.

			When [query] is given the code action starting with
			[query] will be applied. [query] can be a regexp
			pattern, or a digit corresponding to the index of the
			code actions in the created prompt.

			When [query] is not given you will be prompted to select
			one of the actions supplied by the language server.

						*:LspCodeLens*
:LspCodeLens		Display a list of code lens commands available for the
			current buffer and apply the selected code lens
			command.

						*:LspDiagCurrent*
:LspDiagCurrent		Displays the diagnostic message (if any) for the
			current line.  If the option 'showDiagInPopup' is set
			to v:true (default), then the message is displayed in
			a popup window.  Otherwise the message is displayed in
			the status message area.

:LspDiagCurrent!	Only display a diagnostic message if it's directly under
			the cursor.  Otherwise works exactly like
			|:LspDiagCurrent|

			To show the current diagnotic under the cursor while
			moving around the following autocmd can be used: >

			    augroup LspCustom
			    au!
			    au CursorMoved * silent! LspDiagCurrent!
			    augroup END
<
						*:LspDiagFirst*
:LspDiagFirst		Jumps to the location of the first diagnostic message
			for the current file.

						*:LspDiagHere*
:LspDiagHere		Jumps to the location of the diagnostic message in
			the current line (start from current column).

:LspDiagHighlightDisable			*:LspDiagHighlightDisable*
			Disable highlighting lines with a diagnostic message
			for the current Vim session.
			To always disable the highlighting, set the
			autoHighlightDiags option to false.

						*:LspDiagHighlightEnable*
:LspDiagHighlightEnable	Enable highlighting lines with a diagnostic message
			for the current Vim session.  Note that highlighting
			lines with a diagnostic message is enabled by default.

						*:LspDiagLast*
:LspDiagLast		Jumps to the location of the first diagnostic message
			for the current file.

						*:LspDiagNext*
:[count]LspDiagNext	Go to the [count] diagnostic message after the current
			cursor position.  If [count] is omitted, then 1 is used.
			If [count] exceeds the number of diagnostics after the
			current position, then the last diagnostic is selected.

						*:LspDiagPrev*
:[count]LspDiagPrev	Go to the [count] diagnostic message before the current
			cursor position.  If [count] is omitted, then 1 is used.
			If [count] exceeds the number of diagnostics before the
			current position, then first last diagnostic is selected.

						*:LspDiagShow*
:LspDiagShow		Creates a new location list with the diagnostics
			messages (if any) from the language server for the
			current file and opens the location list window. You
			can use the Vim location list commands to browse the
			list.

						*:LspFold*
:LspFold		Create folds for the current buffer.

						*:LspFormat*
:LspFormat		Format the current file using the language server. The
			'shiftwidth' and 'expandtab' values set for the current
			buffer are used when format is applied.

:{range}LspFormat	Format the specified range of lines in the current
			file using the language server.

						*:LspGotoDeclaration*
:[count]LspGotoDeclaration
			Jumps to the declaration of the symbol under the
			cursor. The behavior of this command is similar to the
			|:LspGotoDefinition| command.

						*:LspGotoDefinition*
:[count]LspGotoDefinition
			Jumps to the [count] definition of the symbol under the
			cursor.  If there are multiple matches and [count] isn't
			specified, then a location list will be created with the
			list of locations.

			If there is only one location, or [count] is provided
			then the following will apply:

			If the file is already present in a window, then jumps
			to that window.  Otherwise, opens the file in a new
			window.  If the current buffer is modified and 'hidden'
			is not set or if the current buffer is a special buffer,
			then a new window is opened.  If the jump is successful,
			then the current cursor location is pushed onto the tag
			stack.  The |CTRL-T| command can be used to go back up
			the tag stack.  Also the |``| mark is set to the
			position before the jump.

			This command supports |:command-modifiers|.  You can
			use the modifiers to specify whether a new window or
			a new tab page is used and where the window is opened.
			Example(s): >

			    # Open a horizontally split window
			    :topleft LspGotoDefinition
			    # Open a vertically split window
			    :vert LspGotoDefinition
			    # Open a new tab page
			    :tab LspGotoDefinition
<
			You may want to map a key to invoke this command: >

	    nnoremap <buffer> gd <Cmd>LspGotoDefinition<CR>
	    nnoremap <buffer> <C-W>gd <Cmd>topleft LspGotoDefinition<CR>
<
			Or if you want to support [count]gd >

	    nnoremap <buffer> gd <Cmd>execute v:count .. 'LspGotoDefinition'<CR>
	    nnoremap <buffer> <C-W>gd <Cmd>execute 'topleft ' .. v:count .. 'LspGotoDefinition'<CR>
<
						*:LspGotoImpl*
:[count]LspGotoImpl	Jumps to the implementation of the symbol under the
			cursor. The behavior of this command is similar to the
			|:LspGotoDefinition| command. Note that not all the
			language servers support this feature.

			You may want to map a key to invoke this command: >

			    nnoremap <buffer> gi <Cmd>LspGotoImpl<CR>
<
						*:LspGotoTypeDef*
:[count]LspGotoTypeDef	Jumps to the type definition of the symbol under the
			cursor. The behavior of this command is similar to the
			|:LspGotoDefinition| command. Note that not all the
			language servers support this feature.

			You may want to map a key to invoke this command: >

			    nnoremap <buffer> gt <Cmd>LspGotoTypeDef<CR>
<
						*:LspHighlight*
:LspHighlight		Highlights all the matches for the symbol under
			cursor. The text, read and write references to the
			symbol are highlighted using Search, DiffChange and
			DiffDelete highlight groups respectively.

						*:LspHighlightClear*
:LspHighlightClear	Clears all the symbol matches highlighted by the
			|:LspHighlight| command.

						*:LspHover*
:LspHover		Show the documentation for the symbol under the cursor
			in a popup window. If you want to show the symbol
			documentation in the preview window instead of in a
			popup set >

			    call LspOptionsSet({'hoverInPreview': v:true})
<
			Default is false.

						*:LspIncomingCalls*
:LspIncomingCalls	Display a hierarchy of symbols calling the symbol
			under the cursor in a window.  See
			|lsp-call-hierarchy| for more information.  Note that
			not all the language servers support this feature.

						*:LspOutoingCalls*
:LspOutoingCalls	Display a hierarchy of symbols called by the symbol
			under the cursor in a window.  See
			|lsp-call-hierarchy| for more information.  Note that
			not all the language servers support this feature.

						*:LspOutline*
:[count]LspOutline	Opens a vertically split window with the list of
			symbols defined in the current file. The current
			symbol is highlighted. The symbols are grouped by
			their type. You can select a symbol and press <Enter>
			to jump to the position of the symbol. As you move the
			cursor in a file, the current symbol is automatically
			highlighted in the outline window. If you open a new
			file, the outline window is automatically updated with
			the symbols in the new file.  Folds are created in the
			outline window for the various group of symbols.

			You can use |lsp-opt-outlineOnRight| and
			|lsp-opt-outlineWinSize| to customize the placement and
			size of the window.

			This command also supports |:command-modifiers|.  You
			can use the modifiers specify the position of the
			window.  Note that the default is ":vert :topleft" or
			":vert :botright" depending on |lsp-opt-outlineOnRight|

			This command also supports providing a [count] to
			specify the size of the window.  Note that this
			overrides the values defined in |lsp-opt-outlineWinSize|
			Example: >

			    # Open the outline window just above the current window
			    :aboveleft LspOutline

			    # Open the outline window just next to the current
			    # window, this is different from the default, when
			    # you have multiple splits already
			    :vert aboveleft LspOutline

			    # Same as above, but with a width of 50
			    :vert aboveleft 50LspOutline
<
						*:LspPeekDeclaration*
:[count]LspPeekDeclaration
			Displays the line where the symbol under the
			cursor is declared in a popup window. The
			behavior of this command is similar to the
			|:LspPeekDefinition| command.

						*:LspPeekDefinition*
:[count]LspPeekDefinition
			Displays the line where the symbol under the cursor is
			defined in a popup window. The symbol is highlighted
			in the popup window. Moving the cursor or pressing
			<Esc> will close the popup window.
			When more than one symbol is found all of them will be
			shown.  The corresponding file for the symbol is
			displayed in another popup window.  As the selection in
			the symbol popup menu changes, the file in the popup is
			updated.
			When [count] is provided only the [count] symbol will be
			shown.

						*:LspPeekImpl*
:[count]LspPeekImpl	Displays the implementation of the symbol under the
			cursor in a popup window. The behavior of this
			command is similar to the |:LspPeekDefinition|
			command. Note that not all the language servers
			support this feature.

						*:LspPeekReferences*
:LspPeekReferences	Displays the list of references to the symbol under
			cursor in a popup menu.  The corresponding file for
			the reference is displayed in another popup window.
			As the selection in the reference popup menu changes,
			the file in the popup is updated.

						*:LspPeekTypeDef*
:[count]LspPeekTypeDef	Displays the line where the type of the symbol under
			the cursor is defined in a popup window. The
			behavior of this command is similar to the
			|:LspPeekDefinition| command. Note that not all the
			language servers support this feature.

						*:LspRename*
:LspRename [newName]	Rename the current symbol.

			When [newName] is not given, then you will be prompted
			to enter the new name for the symbol. You can press
			<Esc> or enter an empty string in the prompt to cancel
			the operation.

						*:LspSelectionExpand*
:LspSelectionExpand	Visually select the region of the symbol under the
			cursor.  In visual mode, expands the current symbol
			visual region selection to include the next level.

			For example, if the cursor is on a "for" statement,
			this command selects the "for" statement and the body
			of the "for" statement.

			It is useful to create a visual map to use this
			command.  Example: >

			xnoremap <silent> <Leader>e <Cmd>LspSelectionExpand<CR>
<
			With the above map, you can press "\e" in visual mode
			successively to expand the current symbol visual
			region.

						*:LspSelectionShrink*
:LspSelectionShrink	Shrink the current symbol range visual selection. It
			is useful to create a visual map to use this command.
			Example: >

			xnoremap <silent> <Leader>s <Cmd>LspSelectionShrink<CR>
<
			With the above map, you can press "\s" in visual mode
			successively to shrink the current symbol visual
			region.

						*:LspServer*
:LspServer { debug | restart | show | trace }
			Command to display and control the language server for
			the current buffer.  Each argument has additional
			sub-commands which are described below.

			debug { on | off | messages | errors }
			    Command to enable or disable the language server
			    debug messages and to display the debug messages
			    and error messages received from the language
			    server.  The following sub-commands are supported:
				errors	Open the log file containing the
					language server error messages.
				messages
					Open the log file containing the
					language server debug messages.
				off	Disable the logging of the language
					server messages.
				on	Enable the logging of the messages
					emitted by the language server in the
					standard output and standard error.
			    By default, the language server messages are not
			    logged.  On a Unix-like system, when enabled,
			    these messages are logged to the
			    /tmp/lsp-<server-name>.log and
			    /tmp/lsp-<server-name>.err file respectively.  On
			    MS-Windows, the %TEMP%/lsp-<server-name>.log and
			    %TEMP%/lsp-<server-name>.err% files are used. See
			    |lsp-debug| for more information.

			restart
			    Restart (stop and then start) the language server
			    for the current buffer. All the loaded buffers
			    with the same filetype as the current buffer are
			    added back to the server.

			show {capabilities | initializeRequest | messages
								| status}
			    The following sub-commands are supported:
				capabilities
					Display the list of language server
					capabilities for the current buffer.
					The server capabilities are described
					in the LSP protocol specification
					under the "ServerCapabilities"
					interface.
				initializeRequest
					Display the contents of the language
					server initialization request message
					(initialize).
				messages
					Display the log messages received from
					the language server.  This includes
					the messages received using the
					"window/logMessage" and "$/logTrace"
					LSP notifications.
				status
					Display the language server status for
					the current buffer.  The output shows
					the path to the language server
					executable and the server status.

			trace { off | messages | verbose }
			    Set the language server debug trace value using
			    the "$/setTrace" command.

						*:LspShowAllServers*
:LspShowAllServers	Displays the list of registered language servers and
			their status.  The language servers are registered
			using the LspAddServer() function.  The output is
			displayed in a scratch buffer.  The output shows the
			Vim file type, the corresponding language server
			status and the path to the language server executable.
			The language server information for each buffer is
			also shown.

						*:LspShowReferences*
:LspShowReferences	Creates a new location list with the list of locations
			where the symbol under the cursor is referenced and
			opens the location window.  If you want to show the
			references in a quickfix list instead of in a location
			list set >

			call LspOptionsSet({'useQuickfixForLocations': v:true})
<
						*:LspShowSignature*
:LspShowSignature	Displays the signature of the symbol (e.g. a function
			or method) before the cursor in a popup.

			The popup is also automatically displayed in insert
			mode after entering a symbol name followed by a
			separator (e.g. a opening parenthesis). To disable
			this, you can set the showSignature option to false in
			your .vimrc file: >

			call LspOptionsSet({'showSignature': v:false})
<
			Default is true.

			You can get the function signature echoed in cmdline
			rather than displayed in popup if you use >

			call LspOptionsSet({'echoSignature': v:true})
<
			Default is false.

						*:LspSubTypeHierarchy*
:LspSubTypeHierarchy	Show the sub type hierarchy for the symbol under the
			cursor in a popup window.  The file containing the
			type is shown in another popup window.  You can jump
			to the location where a type is defined by browsing the
			popup menu and selecting an entry.

						*:LspSuperTypeHierarchy*
:LspSuperTypeHierarchy	Show the super type hierarchy for the symbol under the
			cursor in a popup window.  The file containing the
			type is shown in another popup window.  As the current
			entry in the type hierarchy popup menu changes, the
			file popup window is updated to show the location
			where the type is defined.  You can jump to the
			location where a type is defined by selecting the
			entry in the popup menu.

			Note that the type hierarchy support is based on the
			protocol supported by clangd.  This is different from
			the one specified in the 3.17 of the LSP standard.

						*:LspSwitchSourceHeader*
:LspSwitchSourceHeader	Switch between source and header files. This is a
			Clangd specific extension and only works with C/C++
			source files.

						*:LspSymbolSearch*
:LspSymbolSearch <sym>	Perform a workspace wide search for the symbol <sym>.
			If <sym> is not supplied, then you will be prompted to
			enter the symbol name (the keyword under the cursor is
			used as the default).  A popup window is opened with
			the list of matching symbols.  You can enter a few
			characters to narrow down the list of matches. The
			displayed symbol name can be erased by pressing
			<Backspace> or <C-U> and a new symbol search pattern
			can be entered.  You can close the popup menu by
			pressing the escape key or by pressing CTRL-C.

			In the popup menu, the following keys can be used:

				CTRL-F     - Scroll one page forward
				<PageDown> - idem
				CTRL-B     - Scroll one page backward
				<PageUp>   - idem
				CTRL-Home  - Jump to the first entry
				CTRL-End   - Jump to the last entry
				<Up>       - Go up one entry
				<C-P>      - idem
				<Down>     - Go down one entry
				<C-N>      - idem
				<Enter>    - Open the selected file
				<Esc>      - Close the popup menu
				<CTRL-C>   - idem
				<BS>       - Erase one character from the
					     filter text
				<C-H>      - idem
				<C-U>      - Erase the filter text

			Any other alphanumeric key will be used to narrow down
			the list of names displayed in the popup menu. When
			you type a filter string, then only the symbols fuzzy
			matching the string are displayed in the popup menu.
			You can enter a new search pattern to do a workspace
			wide symbol search.

						*:LspWorkspaceAddFolder*
:LspWorkspaceAddFolder {folder}
			Add a folder to the workspace

:LspWorkspaceListFolders			*:LspWorkspaceListFolders*
			Show the list of folders in the workspace.

						*:LspWorkspaceRemoveFolder*
:LspWorkspaceRemoveFolder {folder}
			Remove a folder from the workspace

==============================================================================
6. Insert mode completion

By default, in insert mode, the LSP plugin automatically displays the matches
for the symbol under the cursor in an insert-completion popup menu. You can
use the keys described in |popupmenu-keys| with this menu.

To disable the auto-compeltion, you can set the autoComplete option to v:false
in your .vimrc file: >

	call LspOptionsSet({'autoComplete': v:false})
<
If this variable is set, then the LSP plugin doesn't automatically start
completion in insert mode and instead supports omni-completion (|compl-omni|).
It sets the 'omnifunc' option for the buffers which have a registered language
server. To complete a symbol in insert mode manually, you can press CTRL-X
CTRL-O to invoke completion using the items suggested by the language server.

You can also enable or disable omni-completion based on a file type by setting
the 'omnicompl' item to 'false' when registering a lsp server for the
filetype. If this item is not specified, then omni-completion is enabled by
default. The following example disables omni-completion for python: >

	let lspServers = [
		\     {
		\	'filetype': 'python',
		\	'omnicompl': v:false,
		\	'path': '/usr/local/bin/pyls',
		\	'args': ['--check-parent-process', '-v']
		\     }
		\   ]
<
If you want to use omni completion, in addition to the automatic completion,
then you can set the 'omnifunc' option to the "g:LspOmniFunc" function: >

	set omnifunc=g:LspOmniFunc
<
To use omni completion, press CTRL-X CTRL-O in insert mode.  Refer to
|compl-omni| for more information.

When doing insert-mode completion, the plugin sends a request message to the
language server to return a list of possible completion matches for the
current cursor position.  The plugin retrieves the keyword before the cursor
(see 'iskeyword') and then filters the returned list of completion items
against this keyword and displays the completion menu.  Some language servers
does completion filtering in the server, while other relies on the client to
do the filtering.  By default, case sensitive comparison is used to filter the
returned items.  You can modify the 'completionMatcher' option to use either
case insensitive or fuzzy comparison.

==============================================================================
7. Diagnostics

When a source file has syntax errors or warnings or static analysis warnings,
the LSP plugin highlights them by placing |signs| in the |sign-column|.  You
can use the |:LspDiagShow| command to display all the diagnostic messages for
the current file in a |location-list-window|.  You can use the |:LspDiagFirst|
command to jump to the line with the first diagnostic message, the
|:LspDiagNext| command to jump to the next nearest line with the diagnostic
message, the |:LspDiagPrev| command to jump to the previous nearest line with
the diagnostic message, the |:LspDiagHere| command to jump to the diagnostic
message in the current line.  You can use the |:LspDiagCurrent| command to
display the entire diagnostic message from the language server for the current
line.

By default, the lines with a diagnostic message have a sign placed on them and
are highlighted.  You can temporarily disable them for the current Vim session
using the |:LspDiagHighlightDisable| command and re-enable them using the
|:LspDiagHighlightEnable| command.

To disable the automatic placement of signs on the lines with a diagnostic
message, you can set the 'autoHighlightDiags' option to v:false: >

	call LspOptionsSet({'autoHighlightDiags': v:false})
<
By default the 'autoHighlightDiags' option is set to v:true.

The function lsp#lsp#ErrorCount() function can be used to get the count of the
diagnostic messages in the current buffer by type.  This function returns a
Dictionary with the following keys: Info, Hint, Warn and Error.  The value for
these keys is the number of diagnostic messages of the corresponding type.
This function can be used to display the number of diagnostics in the current
buffer in a 'statusline'.

For some diagnostic errors/warnings, the language server may provide an
automatic fix.  To apply this fix, you can use the |:LspCodeAction| command.
This command applies the action provided by the language server (if any) for
the current line.

The |:LspDiagShow| command creates a new location list with the current list
of diagnostics for the current buffer.  To automatically add the diagnostics
messages to the location list, you can set the 'autoPopulateDiags' option to
v:true.  By default this option is set to v:false.

When using GUI Vim or in a terminal Vim with 'ballooneval' option set, when
the mouse is moved over the diagnostic sign displayed in the sign column, then
the diagnostic message is displayed in a popup.  By default, the diagnostic
message popup is not displayed when the mouse is moved over the text in the
line. To display the diagnostic message when hovering the mouse over the text
of the line, you can set the 'noDiagHoverOnLine' option to v:false.  By
default, this option is set to v:true.

To display the diagnostic message for the current line in the status area, you
can set the 'showDiagOnStatusLine' option to v:true.  By default, this option
is set to v:false.

By default, the |:LspDiagCurrent| command displays the diagnostic message for
the current line in a popup window.  To display the message in the status
message area instead, you can set the 'showDiagInPopup' option to false.  By
default this is set to true.

==============================================================================
8. Tag Function					*lsp-tagfunc*

The |:LspGotoDefinition| command can be used jump to the location where a
symbol is defined.  To jump to the symbol definition using the Vim
|tag-commands|, you can set the 'tagfunc' option to the 'lsp#lsp#TagFunc'
function: >

	setlocal tagfunc=lsp#lsp#TagFunc
<
After setting the above option, you can use |Ctrl-]| and other tag related
commands to jump to the symbol definition.

Note that most of the language servers return only one symbol location even if
the symbol is defined in multiple places in the code.

==============================================================================
9. Code Formatting				*lsp-format*

The |:LspFormat| command can be used to format either the entire file or a
selected range of lines using the language server.  The 'shiftwidth' and
'expandtab' values set for the current buffer are used when format is applied.

To format code using the 'gq' command, you can set the 'formatexpr' option: >

    setlocal formatexpr=lsp#lsp#FormatExpr()
<
==============================================================================
10. Call Hierarchy				*lsp-call-hierarchy*

The |:LspIncomingCalls| and the |:LspOutoingCalls| commands can be used to
display the call hierarchy of a symbol.  For example, the functions calling a
function or the functions called by a function.  These two commands open a
window containing the call hierarchy tree.  You can use the Vim motion
commands to browse the call hierarchy.

In the call hierarchy tree window, the following keys are supported:

<Enter>				Jump to the location of the symbol under the
				cursor.
-				Expand and show the symbols calling or called
				by the symbol under the cursor.
+				Close the call hierarchy for the symbol under
				the cursor.

You can display either the incoming call hierarchy or the outgoing call
hierarchy in this window.  You cannot display both at the same time.

In the call hierarchy tree window, the following commands are supported:

						*:LspCallHierarchyRefresh*
:LspCallHierarchyRefresh	Query the language server again for the top
				level symbol and refresh the call hierarchy
				tree.
						*:LspCallHierarchyIncoming*
:LspCallHierarchyIncoming	Display the incoming call hierarchy for the
				top level symbol.  If the window is currently
				displaying the outgoing calls, then it is
				refreshed to display the incoming calls.
						*:LspCallHierarchyOutgoing*
:LspCallHierarchyOutgoing	Display the outgoing call hierarchy for the
				top level symbol.  If the window is currently
				displaying the incoming calls, then it is
				refreshed to display the outgoing calls.

==============================================================================
11. Autocommands				*lsp-autocmds*

						*LspAttached*
LspAttached			A |User| autocommand fired when the LSP client
				attaches to a buffer. Can be used to configure
				buffer-local mappings or options.

						*LspDiagsUpdated*
LspDiagsUpdated			A |User| autocommand invoked when new
				diagnostics are received from the language
				server.  This is invoked after the LSP client
				has processed the diagnostics.

==============================================================================
12. Highlight Groups				*lsp-highlight-groups*

The following highlight groups are used by the LSP plugin.  You can define
these highlight groups in your .vimrc file before sourcing this plugin to
override them.

*LspDiagInlineError*		Used to highlight inline error diagnostics.
				By default, linked to the "SpellBad" highlight
				group.
*LspDiagInlineHint*		Used to highlight inline hint diagnostics.
				By default, linked to the "SpellLocal"
				highlight group.
*LspDiagInlineInfo*		Used to highlight inline info diagnostics.
				By default, linked to the "SpellRare" highlight
				group.
*LspDiagInlineWarning*		Used to highlight inline warning diagnostics.
				By default, linked to the "SpellCap" highlight
				group.
*LspDiagLine*			Used to highlight a line with one or more
				diagnostics.  By default linked to the
				"DiffAdd" highlight group.  Use "NONE" to
				disable.
*LspDiagSignErrorText*		Used to highlight the sign text for error
				diags.  By default linked to 'ErrorMsg'.
*LspDiagSignHintText*		Used to highlight the sign text for hint
				diags.  By default linked to 'Question'.
*LspDiagSignInfoText*		Used to highlight the sign text for info
				diags.  By default linked to 'Pmenu'.
*LspDiagSignWarningText*	Used to highlight the sign text for warning
				diags.  By default linked to 'Search'.
*LspDiagVirtualText*		Used to highlight diagnostic virtual text.
				By default, linked to the "LineNr" highlight
				group.
*LspInlayHintsParam*		Used to highlight inlay hints of kind
				"parameter".  By default, linked to the
				"Label" highlight group.
*LspInlayHintsType*		Used to highlight inlay hints of kind "type".
				By default, linked to the "Conceal" highlight
				group.
*LspSigActiveParameter*		Used to highlight the active signature
				parameter.  By default, linked to the "LineNr"
				highlight group.

For example, to override the highlight used for diagnostics virtual text, you
can use the following: >

    highlight LspDiagVirtualText ctermfg=Cyan guifg=Blue
<
or >

    highlight link LspDiagLine NONE
    highlight link LspDiagVirtualText WarningMsg
<
==============================================================================
13. Debugging					*lsp-debug*

To debug this plugin, you can log the language server protocol messages sent
and received by the plugin from the language server.  The following command
enables the logging of the messages from the language server for the current
buffer: >

    :LspServer debug on
<
This command also clears the log files.  The following command disables the
logging of the messages from the language server for the current buffer: >

    :LspServer debug off
<
By default, the messages are not logged.  Another method to enable the debug
is to set the "debug" field to v:true when adding a language server
using |LspAddServer()|.

The messages printed by the language server in the stdout are logged to the
lsp-<server-name>.log file and the messages printed in the stderr are logged
to the lsp-<server-name>.err file.  On a Unix-like system, these files are
created in the /tmp directory.  On MS-Windows, these files are created in the
%TEMP% directory.

The following command opens the file containing the messages printed by the
language server in the stdout: >

    :LspServer debug messages
<
The following command opens the file containing the messages printed by the
language server in the stderr: >

    :LspServer debug errors
<
To debug language server initialization problems, after enabling the above
server debug, you can restart the server for the file type in the current
buffer using the following command: >

    :LspServer restart
<
The language servers typically support command line options to enable debug
messages and to increase the verbosity of the messages.  You can refer to the
language server documentation for information about this.  You can include
these options when registering the language server with this plugin.

If a language server supports the "$/logTrace" LSP notification, then you can
use the :LspServerTrace command to set the server trace value: >

    :LspServer trace { off | messages | verbose }
<
==============================================================================
14. Custom Command Handlers			*lsp-custom-commands*

When applying a code action, the language server may issue a non-standard
command.  For example, the Java language server uses non-standard commands
(e.g. java.apply.workspaceEdit).  To handle these commands, you can register a
callback function for each command using the LspRegisterCmdHandler() function.
For example: >

    vim9script
    import autoload "lsp/textedit.vim"

    def WorkspaceEdit(cmd: dict<any>)
      for editAct in cmd.arguments
	  textedit.ApplyWorkspaceEdit(editAct)
      endfor
    enddef
    g:LspRegisterCmdHandler('java.apply.workspaceEdit', WorkspaceEdit)
<
Place the above code in a file named lsp_java/plugin/lsp_java.vim and load
this plugin.

The callback function should accept a Dict argument.  The Dict argument
contains the LSP Command interface fields.  Refer to the LSP specification for
more information about the "Command" interface.

==============================================================================
15. Custom LSP Completion Kinds			*lsp-custom-kinds*

When a completion popup is triggered, the LSP client will use a default kind
list to show in the completion "kind" section, to customize it, you need to
use the option |lsp-opt-customCompletionKinds| and set all custom kinds in the
option |lsp-opt-completionKinds| . There is a table with all default LSP kinds:

 Kind Name              | Value
------------------------|--------------------
 Text                   | t
 Method                 | m
 Function               | f
 Constructor            | C
 Field                  | F
 Variable               | v
 Class                  | c
 Interface              | i
 Module                 | M
 Property               | p
 Unit                   | u
 Value                  | V
 Enum                   | e
 Keyword                | k
 Snippet                | S
 Color                  | C
 File                   | f
 Reference              | r
 Folder                 | F
 EnumMember             | E
 Constant               | d
 Struct                 | s
 Event                  | E
 Operator               | o
 TypeParameter          | T

For example, if you want to change the "Method" kind to the kind "method()": >

	vim9script

16. Multiple Language Servers for a buffer	*lsp-multiple-servers*

It's possible to run multiple language servers for a given buffer.

By default the language server defined first will be used for as much as it
supports, then the next and so on. With the exception that diagnostics from all
running language servers will be combined.

This means that you can define a language server that only supports a subset of
features at first and then define the general purpose language server after it:
>
	vim9script

	g:LspAddServer([
		# This language server reports that it only supports
		# textDocument/documentFormatting, so it will be used
		# for :LspFormat but nothing else.
		{
			filetype: ['html'],
			path: 'html-pretty-lsp',
			args: ['--stdio']
		},
		# This language server also supports
		# textDocument/documentFormatting, but since it's been
		# defined later, the one above will be used instead.
		# However this server also supports
		# textDocument/definition, textDocument/declaration,
		# etc, so it will be used for :LspGotoDefinition,
		# :LspGotoDeclaration, etc
		{
			filetype: ['html'],
			path: 'html-language-server',
			args: ['--stdio']
		}
	])
<
As shown in the example above the order of when the language servers are being
defined is taken into account for a given method.  However sometimes the
language server that you want to use for formatting also reports that it
supports other features. In such a case you can do one of two things:

1. change the order of language servers, and specify that a given language
server should be used for a given method.

2. set the unwanted features to |v:false| in the features |Dictionary| >

	features: { 'codeAction': v:false }
<
For example, if you want to use the efm-langserver for formatting, but the
typescript-language-server for everything else: >

	vim9script

	g:LspAddServer([
		# this language server will be used by default, as it's defined
		# as the first LSP for 'javascript' and 'typescript'
		{
			filetype: ['javascript', 'typescript'],
			path: '/usr/local/bin/typescript-language-server',
			args: ['--stdio']
		},
		# this language server will be used for documentFormatting
		{
			filetype: ['efm-langserver'],
			path: '/usr/local/bin/efm-langserver',
			args: [],
			features: {
				documentFormatting: true
			}
		}
	])
<
Another way is to disable the unwanted features: for example if you don't want
diagnostics from the typescript-language-server, but want to use it for
everything else: >

	vim9script

	g:LspAddServer([
		{
			filetype: ['javascript', 'typescript'],
			path: '/usr/local/bin/typescript-language-server',
			args: ['--stdio'],
			features: {
				diagnostics: false
			}
		},
	])

17. Language Server Features			*lsp-features*

By providing the configuration |lsp-cfg-features| it's possible to specify which
servers should be used for a given method.  The following feature flags are
supported: See |lsp-multiple-servers| for examples.

						*lsp-features-codeAction*
codeAction			Used by |:LspCodeAction|
						*lsp-features-codeLens*
codeLens			Used by |:LspCodeLens|
						*lsp-features-completion*
completion			Used by 24/7 Completion and 'omnifunc'
						*lsp-features-declaration*
declaration			Used by |:LspGotoDeclaration|, and
				|:LspPeekDeclaration|
						*lsp-features-definition*
definition			Used by |:LspGotoDefinition|, and
				|:LspPeekDefinition|
						*lsp-features-diagnostics*
diagnostics			Used to disable diagnostics for a single
				language server, by default diagnostics are
				combined from all running servers, by setting
				this to |v:false| you can ignore diagnostics
				from a specific server.
						*lsp-features-documentFormatting*
documentFormatting		Used by |:LspFormat|, and 'formatexpr'
						*lsp-features-documentHighlight*
documentHighlight		Used by |:LspHighlight|, and |:LspHighlightClear|
						*lsp-features-foldingRange*
foldingRange			Used by |:LspFold|
						*lsp-features-hover*
hover				Used by |:LspHover|
						*lsp-features-implementation*
implementation			Used by |:LspGotoImpl|, and |:LspPeekImpl|
						*lsp-features-references*
references			Used by |:LspShowReferences|
						*lsp-features-rename*
rename				Used by |:LspRename|
						*lsp-features-selectionRange*
selectionRange			Used by |:LspSelectionExpand|, and |:LspSelectionShrink|
						*lsp-features-typeDefinition*
typeDefinition			Used by |:LspGotoTypeDef|, and |:LspPeekTypeDef|
